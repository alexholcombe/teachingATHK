## Important Readings

* To find definitions of some of the terms in this document, open [Vocab_ReadingsATHK2017statsAndStudies.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexholcombe/teachingATHK/master/Vocab_ReadingsATHKstatsAndStudies.Rmd) and you'll see some definitions in the comments, embedded in "\<!-- \-->", yielding something like `<!--- definition text -->`. 
Quiz yourself with this webpage that doesn't show the definition, and subsequently check the definition in the .Rmd version to see if you got it right.  

* [Planet Money podcast](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/178635250) on causation and correlation. Study questions:
  * Why did women take hormone replacement therapy?
  * What kind of study was done to better assess the effect of hormone replacement therapy?
    * Why was this study better than the first evidence that led hormone replacement therapy to originally start?

* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/scatterplots-a1/creating-interpreting-scatterplots/v/correlation-and-causality) on correlation and causality. Study questions:
  * Khan talks about an article that suggests that eating breakfast prevents obesity. He also suggests alternative causal models. Name one.

*  [Alex on the ways the word "control" is used](https://alexholcombe.github.io/teachingATHK/readings/controllingForVsControl.html) and random assignment.

* Another [explanation of random assignment](http://isps.yale.edu/node/16697).

* [What is a confounding variable?](http://www.statisticshowto.com/design-of-experiments/confounding-variable/)

* [Comic book](https://thenib.com/repeat-after-me/) about p-hacking and publication bias and the "replication crisis" (for Week 9)

<!-- Critical Thinking, by Paul and Elder -->

## Not-so-important Readings

* [John Oliver video starting at 1:46](https://youtu.be/0Rnq1NpHdmw?t=105) on p-hacking

* Chapter 4, Correlation, of *Naked Statistics* (already recommended by Bruce)

* To understand how regression can "control for" an extraneous variable, read *Naked Statistics* Chapter 11 and the “Highly correlated explanatory variables” in Ch.12.

* [r-squared](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics/regression-analysis-how-do-i-interpret-r-squared-and-assess-the-goodness-of-fit)

* https://alexholcombe.wordpress.com/2016/02/03/problems-with-controlling-for-variables-quick-notes/ The first few paragraphs are helpful for explaining "controlling for", but then it quickly becomes more complex and more advanced than is needed for this class.

* TEDxDHFastStream - Dr Ben Goldacre talking about [randomised controlled trials for public policy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzRs7cPrrfE)

# Vocabulary (partial list, see more terms on the outline)

* Correlation, used in this class to refer only to linear correlation.
* Observational study.
<!-- Study that is NOT an experiment (no experimenter manipulation of critical variable, or random assignment of people to one of e.g. two groups) -->
* Quasi / natural experiment
* Random assignment ([explainer](http://isps.yale.edu/node/16697))
* r
* r-squared and shared variance
* Proportion of variance explained, shared variance
<!-- Squaring r gives the proportion of variance explained by the line. "Shared variance" is a synonym.-->

### Variables
* IV, DV <!-- Independent variable, dependent variable. -->
* Explanatory variable
* Extraneous variable
<!-- When one compares two groups, one is seeking to determine the effect of an explanatory variable or variables. But extraneous variables are variables that also differ between the two groups. They may be confounds. -->
* Confound or confounding variables
<!-- Confounds are sometimes known as omitted variables in the context of observational studies or in the context of a statistical model like a regression. In experiment design, you might be interested in the effect of videogames on agression. You recruit a group of videogamers and another group of non-gamers and assess their agression level (somehow). You find that the videogamers are more agressive. Does this mean that videogaming causes agression? No, because you might have a confounding variable like age. Videogamers tend to be younger so your videogaming group may be younger than your non-gaming group. And, aggression levels decrease with age (and this was true even before videogames was invented), meaning that perhaps the only reason gamers are more violent is because they are younger.

-->
* Omitted variable
<!-- This term is used in the context of observational studies, where Bruce used it to refer to a problematic variable that in an experimental study would be referred to as
a "confound"-->
* "Controlling for" a variable 

<!--This was in Bruce and Alex's lectures and means a confound that you try to compensate for using statistics, to reveal the causal relationship between IV and DV without contamination by the confound. Usually happens in observational studies but can sometimes happen in experiments.
Also explained in https://alexholcombe.wordpress.com/2016/02/03/problems-with-controlling-for-variables-quick-notes/-->

* Controlled variable  
<!--In the Evidence tutorial, we used this to mean a variable that you ensure does not differ between the two groups in a simple experiment. This is in distinction to the independent variable, which is a variable you do want to differ between the two groups-->

### Other terms
* Spurious correlation
<!-- Correlation between X and Y that one might think is due to X causing Y, or Y causing X, but isn't -->
* Causal model
* Contingency table
* Residual
* Nonlinear model
* False positive, true positive, false negative, true negative
* Specificity and sensitivity
