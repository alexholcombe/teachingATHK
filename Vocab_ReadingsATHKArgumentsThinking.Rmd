For the words on this page underlined with tiny dots, a short definition will pop up if you hover over the word with your mouse pointer. Here's an example:  <abbr title="Alex is a middle-aged man who is lecturing from weeks 7 to 13.">Alex</abbr>. To study, first ask yourself on what the word means, and then check whether you're right by hovering over the word.

## Tutorial overview

Week 8 tutorial: Causal models, scientific studies, and confounds

Week 9 tutorial: Necessary and sufficient, if-then, and only-if [explained by Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/lsat/lsat-lessons/logic-toolbox-new/a/logic-toolbox--article--if-x-then-y--sufficiency-and-necessity) and [by Carneades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibjL90iY1d0)

Week 10 tutorial: Deductive and inductive arguments, suppositionally inescapable, inescapable, suppositionally strong, and strong.

Week 11 tutorial: Implicit premises, inductive arguments, identifying conclusions in real-world arguments

Week 12 tutorial: Coupling of beliefs and real-world arguments

Week 13 tutorial: Rhetoric and informal fallacies

## Terminological note

Philosophers typically use "valid" and "sound" for describing deductive arguments, in this class we instead use the terms "suppositionally inescapable" and "inescapable" because they are easier to understand. On all assessments, you will only be tested on these terms.

Philosophers typically use "strong" and "cogent" for describing *inductive* arguments, but in this class we use the terms "suppositionally solid" and "solid" because they are easier to understand. On all assessments, you will only be tested on these terms.

# Vocabulary

* <abbr title="In a debate or argument, just contradicting the other's position without giving reasons">Simple contradiction</abbr>

* <abbr title="Bruce:'Confounding factor is one that varies with both variables being considered and thus obscures their true relationship'.

Because it may affect the outcome variable, we don't know whether it is the confound or the independent variable causing any difference in the outcome variable.">Confound, confounding factor, or confound variable</abbr>.
