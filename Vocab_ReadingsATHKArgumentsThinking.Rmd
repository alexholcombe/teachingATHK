## Tutorial overview

Week 8 tutorial: Confounds

Week 9 tutorial: Necessary and sufficient, if-then, and only-if [explained by Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/lsat/lsat-lessons/logic-toolbox-new/a/logic-toolbox--article--if-x-then-y--sufficiency-and-necessity) and [by Carneades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibjL90iY1d0)

Week 10 tutorial: Deductive and inductive arguments, suppositionally inescapable, inescapable, suppositionally strong, and strong.

Week 11 tutorial: Implicit premises, inductive arguments, identifying conclusions in real-world arguments

Week 12 tutorial: Coupling of beliefs and real-world arguments

Week 13 tutorial: Rhetoric and informal fallacies

## Terminological note

Philosophers typically use "valid" and "sound" for describing deductive arguments, in this class we instead use the terms "suppositionally inescapable" and "inescapable" because they are easier to understand. On all assessments, you will only be tested on these terms.

Philosophers typically use "strong" and "cogent" for describing *inductive* arguments, but in this class we use the terms "suppositionally solid" and "solid" because they are easier to understand. On all assessments, you will only be tested on these terms.

## Important Readings

* To find some definitions of the terms in the Vocabulary section, open   [Vocab_ReadingsATHK2017ArgumentsThinking.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexholcombe/teachingATHK/master/Vocab_ReadingsATHKArgumentsThinking.Rmd) and search for "\<!--" - you'll see definitions of a few of the terms there. 
Quiz yourself with this webpage that doesn't show the definition, and subsequently check the definition in the .Rmd version to see if you got it right.

* [Comic book](https://thenib.com/repeat-after-me/) about p-hacking and publication bias and the "replication crisis" 

# Vocabulary

* Confound, confounding factor, or confound variable <!-- Bruce: "Confounding factor is one that varies with both variables being considered and thus obscures their true relationship". Alex: In an experiment, a confound is something that is different for the different levels of the independent variable. Because it may affect the outcome variable, we don't know whether it is the confound or the independent variable causing any difference in the outcome variable. -->
    * Something that varies with the variable whose effect one is interested in and thus obscures their true relationship

* Enthymeme  <!-- From Greek "in-mind", because the full argument in the mind is not stated. Usually a condensed syllogism where one premise is not explicitly stated.
E.g., "Socrates is mortal because he's human." instead of the usual 
"All humans are mortal. 
Socrates is human. 
Therefore, Socrates is mortal."
-->
* Casting arguments  <!-- Finding and isolating or diagramming the conclusion, premises and logical structure of an argument, usually from natural text -->

* Necessary versus sufficient <!-- If A is necessary for B, every time you have B you have A. If A is sufficient for B, every time you have A you have B -->

* Syllogism <!-- A simple argument comprised of a conclusion drawn from two given premises. -->

* Syllogism form

* Truth table

* Redundant argument

* Casting an argument
