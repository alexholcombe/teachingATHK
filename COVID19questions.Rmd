### Causal reasoning about COVID-19 transmission

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="https://twitter.com/jperla/status/1243349875015553024", out.width = "1000px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/masksNoMasksExplainsIt.png") #You can't change the image directory
``` 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("imagesForRmd/maskNoMasksReactions.png")
``` 

But, with an exponentially-growing pandemic, we don't have time to wait for strong evidence.

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("What idea do you think the creator of this image wished to encourage?",
    answer("Masks prevent COVID-19 cases from growing exponentially.",message="jump"),
    answer("COVID-19 cases encourage mask wearing."),
    answer("Wearing a mask slows the rate of infections.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Masks are an important dependent variable"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
