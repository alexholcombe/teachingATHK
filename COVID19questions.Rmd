## Causal reasoning about COVID-19 transmission

### Q

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="https://twitter.com/jperla/status/1243349875015553024", out.width = "1000px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/masksNoMasksExplainsIt.png") #You can't change the image directory
``` 



```{r ideaimage}
question("What idea do you think the creator of this image wished to encourage?",
    answer("Masks prevent COVID-19 cases from growing exponentially.",message="jump"),
    answer("COVID-19 cases encourage mask wearing."),
    answer("Wearing a mask slows the rate of infections.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Masks are an important dependent variable"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## Install RStudio

### How to install RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment for R. What does that mean? Well, if you think of R as a language, which it is, you can think of RStudio as a program that helps you write and work in the language. RStudio makes programming in R much easier and I suggest that you use it!


```{r ideaimage2}
question("What idea do you think the creator of this image wished to encourage?",
    answer("Masks prevent COVID-19 cases from growing exponentially.",message="jump"),
    answer("COVID-19 cases encourage mask wearing."),
    answer("Wearing a mask slows the rate of infections.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Masks are an important dependent variable"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
)
```



```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/maskNoMasksReactions.png")
``` 

But, with an exponentially-growing pandemic, we don't have time to wait for strong evidence.
