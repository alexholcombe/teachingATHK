## Causal reasoning about COVID-19 transmission

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="https://twitter.com/jperla/status/1243349875015553024", out.width = "750px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/masksNoMasksExplainsIt.png") #You can't change the image directory
``` 

```{r axes}
question("Which is true of the axes of this graph?",
    answer("The horizontal axis is geometric; the vertical is logarithmic."),
    answer("The horizontal axis is linear; the vertical is logarithmic.", correct=TRUE, message="Correct. The vertical axis is logarithmic."),
    answer("The horizontal axis is logarithmic; the vertical is hypergeometric."),
    answer("The horizontal axis is logarithmic; the vertical is logarithmic."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

, message="Correct. Slightly confusing here is that the labels on the vertical axis are not equally spaced, in order to position them at round numbers."

```{r slope}
question("What would a straight line on this graph indicates ?",
    answer("The horizontal axis is geometric; the vertical is logarithmic."),
    answer("The horizontal axis is linear; the vertical is logarithmic.", correct=TRUE),
    answer("The horizontal axis is logarithmic; the vertical is hypergeometric."),
    answer("The horizontal axis is logarithmic; the vertical is logarithmic."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

What may be slightly confusing in the graph is that the labels on the vertical axis are not equally spaced, in order to position them at round numbers.

```{r ideaimage}
question("What idea do you think the person who scrawled on this image wished to encourage?",
    answer("Masks prevent COVID-19 cases from growing exponentially.",message="No, because the lines in the Masks group are fairly linear on this semi-log plot, indicating that they are growing exponentially, just slower than the masks ones"),
    answer("COVID-19 cases encourage mask wearing."),
    answer("Wearing a mask slows the rate of infections.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Masks are an important dependent variable"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## Next

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="https://twitter.com/jperla/status/1243349875015553024", out.width = "750px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/masksNoMasksExplainsIt.png") #You can't change the image directory
``` 

```{r ideaimage2}
question("'Wearing a mask slows the rate of infection' is an example of:",
    answer("An inescapable conclusion.",message="jump"),
    answer("A correlational statement."),
    answer("A causal statement.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("A very ambiguous statement.", message="I don't see anything particularly ambiguous about this."),
    answer("An independently variable statement.", message= "This sentence doesn't mean anything, as far as I know."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

A common mistake people make is to assume there is only one reason for 

```{r ianotherFactor}
question("Other factor(s) that might explain some of the difference between the blue-circled countries and the red ones:",
    answer("Climate.",correct=TRUE),
    answer("Handshaking customs.",correct=TRUE),
    answer("Government diligence in testing and tracing contacts of COVID-19 patients.", correct=TRUE),
    answer("Responsiveness of population to government recommendations.", correct=TRUE),
    answer("Quarantine policy.", correct=TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## Reactions

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/maskNoMasksReactions.png")
``` 


```{r multivariate}
question("What standard approach might be used to try to estimate the effects of mask wearing and temperature?",
    answer("Multivariate regression.",correct=TRUE),
    answer("Standard deviation."),
    answer("Regression to the mean."),
    answer("Post hoc ergo propter hoc.", message="I don't see anything particularly ambiguous about this."),
    allow_retry = TRUE
)
```


But, with an exponentially-growing pandemic, we don't have time to wait for strong evidence.
