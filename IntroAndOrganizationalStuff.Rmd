I'm lecturing from Week 7 to Week 13. My lecture series is divided into two parts:

* Stats and Studies
* Arguments and Thinking

## Where to find stuff

* [Outline](https://alexholcombe.github.io/teachingATHK/outline.html)
That's an outline of nearly all the topics of my lectures, with some links for *some* of the readings.

* Vocab_Readings documents
More readings are listed in the Vocab_Readings documents. There are two:
  * [Vocab_ReadingsATHKstatsAndStudies](https://alexholcombe.github.io/teachingATHK/Vocab_ReadingsATHKstatsAndStudies.html)
  * [Vocab_ReadingsATHKArgumentsThinking](https://alexholcombe.github.io/teachingATHK/Vocab_ReadingsATHKArgumentsThinking.html)
